This utility merges multiple origin annotations into one file. It integrates GNPS annotations (FBMN), SIRIUS, Moldiscovery, and Dereplicator+. Annotations priority is set in this order: First, Experimental match "GNPS/Spectral Match" (Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) level 2), second, High-confidence consensus (MSI level. 3) agreement between Moldiscovery and SIRIUS "Consensus (molD + Sirius)", third, "Moldiscovery" or "Sirius", depending on precursor mass: 1. If Mass > 600 Da: molDiscovery candidate with strict FDR (< 1%).
2. If Mass ≤ 600 Da: Sirius candidate with high COSMIC score (> 0.6). Fourth, the medium-confidence fallback comes from Dereplicator+, or lower-confidence hits from Moldiscovery/Sirius. Finally, Chemical Class Prediction "Sirius/CANOPUS", a poor structural match was found; instead, a chemical class was used.
