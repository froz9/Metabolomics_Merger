This utility merges multiple origin annotations into one file. It integrates GNPS annotations (FBMN), SIRIUS, Moldiscovery, and Dereplicator+. Annotations priority is set in this order: First, Experimental match "GNPS/Spectral Match" (Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) level 2), second, High-confidence consensus (MSI level. 3) agreement between Moldiscovery and SIRIUS "Consensus (molD + Sirius)", third, "Moldiscovery" or "Sirius", depending on precursor mass: Moldiscovery if Mass > 600 Da with strict FDR (< 1%), but If mass ≤ 600 Da with high COSMIC score (> 0.6) SIRIUS is the choosen one. Fourth, the medium-confidence fallback comes from Dereplicator+, or lower-confidence hits from Moldiscovery/Sirius. Finally, if the feature shows a poor structural match, the Chemical Class Prediction "Sirius/CANOPUS" is used.
